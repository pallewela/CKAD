# Agent instructions

## Ignore rules

- **Do not read, edit, search, or reference** any files or directories under `.ignore/`.
- Treat `.ignore/` as out of scope: skip it when exploring the codebase, running searches, or suggesting changes.
- If a user asks about something under `.ignore/`, explain that this project instructs agents to ignore that directory and do not inspect its contents.
