# CKAD 12-Week Study Plan

A structured, hands-on path to the **Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)** exam, aligned to the CKAD Curriculum v1.34. Each week includes concepts, tutorials, labs, speed drills, pitfalls, and solution keys.

## Start Here

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [**Syllabus**](/docs/syllabus/) | Master 12-week plan: phases, weekly topics, 40% theory / 60% hands-on, practical challenges, and speed-run checklist. |
| [**Setup**](/docs/setup/) | Local cluster setup (kind or minikube), kubectl install, and building/running a Go app in the cluster. |

Do **Setup** first so you have a working cluster, then follow the syllabus week by week.

## Weekly Study Material

Each week has a page under [**Weeks**](/docs/weeks/) with:

- **The Concept** — Jargon-free explanation of that week's Kubernetes objects
